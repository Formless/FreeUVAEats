FreeUVAEats
===========

First Rails and Android app, done with partners in a web/mobile dev class

FreeEats is the Android component.

Phase3remake1112 was a poorly named folder, but it is still a Rails app.

The rails app scraped emails from an email account signed up to multiple listservs from UVA organization.
It parses out anything involving free crap given out at events and outputs them to JSON, accessible from the web at large.

The Android app is a simple JSON --> List app, with some Twitter functionality because social media.
